/*
Create a function that will recursively count the number of digits of a number.
Conversion of the number to a string is not allowed, thus, the approach is recursive.

Examples
digitsCount(0) ➞ 1

digitsCount(12345) ➞ 5

digitsCount(1289396387328) ➞ 13
Notes
All inputs are integers but some are in exponential form, so, deal with it accordingly.
It is expected from the challenge-takers to come up with a solution using the concept of recursion or the so-called recursive approach.

function countDigits() {
  //your code
